# Emily Venturino

This is my second Github account for professional development. If you want to see my projects I completed at school, go to https://github.com/ebventurino :)

I graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Tennessee Tech University, concentrating in Painting. A few years ago I decided to take my creative background and dive into the tech world by learning Full Stack Web Development to challenge myself and pursue a new career path. I am a lifelong learner and love learning new technologies, and make a point to discover something new every day.

I have a handful of hobbies I like to do when not developing! I like to lift weights, do yoga, make art, play video games & read. I also got certified to sail by the American Sailing Association in 2020 and take a boat out on the weekends when I can!
